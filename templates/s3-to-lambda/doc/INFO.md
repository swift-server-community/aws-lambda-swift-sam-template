# S3 to Lambda SAM Template

The S3 to Lambda SAM template offers a streamlined approach to deploy serverless applications that trigger AWS Lambda functions in response to events from Amazon S3. Utilizing the Serverless Application Model (SAM) framework, this template simplifies the configuration process for developers. With it, you can swiftly set up event-driven architecture where actions in S3, such as object creation, deletion, or modification, automatically trigger corresponding Lambda functions. This integration allows for seamless handling of file uploads, data processing, or any custom logic without the need for managing server infrastructure. By leveraging SAM, developers can define the event source, specify Lambda function behavior, and manage resources as code, streamlining deployment and maintenance tasks.
