# Scheduler to Lambda SAM Template

The Scheduler to Lambda SAM template provides an efficient way to deploy serverless applications that execute AWS Lambda functions on a predetermined schedule. Leveraging the Serverless Application Model (SAM) framework, this template simplifies the setup process for developers. With it, you can easily define scheduled tasks, specifying the frequency and timing for Lambda function invocation. This integration enables automated execution of tasks such as data backups, periodic data processing, or system maintenance without the need for managing server infrastructure. By utilizing SAM, developers can define the schedule, configure the Lambda function behavior, and manage resources as code, streamlining deployment and maintenance processes.
