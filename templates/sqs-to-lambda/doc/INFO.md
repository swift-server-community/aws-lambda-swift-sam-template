# SQS to Lambda SAM Template

The SQS to Lambda SAM template provides an efficient means to deploy serverless applications that process messages from Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) using AWS Lambda functions. Built on the Serverless Application Model (SAM) framework, this template simplifies configuration tasks for developers. With it, you can seamlessly integrate SQS queues with Lambda functions, enabling asynchronous message processing and decoupling of application components. This integration facilitates scalable and fault-tolerant message processing workflows, where messages from SQS queues trigger corresponding Lambda functions for execution. By leveraging SAM, developers can define the queue settings, configure Lambda function behavior, and manage resources as code, streamlining deployment and maintenance workflows.
